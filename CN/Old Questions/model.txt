routing algorithm is set of operations used in NL to direct internal traffci efficinetly
mathematically determine best path maong multiple for data packet to travel from source to
destinatoin accroess interconnexted netwrosk
dunamic algorithms ensure routers can automatically react to topology canges without manual input

distance vector routing algorithm/bellman ford:

knowledge base: each router maintains a table(vector) ahta list best knowndistance to every
destination along with output line to reach that destination

information exchange: router periodcailly pass a copy of their entire routing table to
directyl connected enighbour routers

update rule: when router receives table, calculate new path cost by adding cost to negihbou
if new calculated path offeres lower cost than curretn entry, router updates it tables to
use new path

DV							LS
knowledge base is limited to neighbour information	full knowledge(toppologicqal database) of
only, non specific knowledge of distatn networks 	all raouters and links within its area
send sentire routing table				sends samll incremental updates(LSA)
update trigger is periodic even if no change occur	event triggered(only when topology changes)
slower, usceptible to routing loops and count to infini	fast convergence

3.
congestion occurs when load on netowrk exceeds its capacity, result in packet dealy/loss
and degraded performance
congestion control technique aims to prevent or remove it

open loop congestion control (prevention): dwara
orevent congestion before it starts iwtouht using real tiem feedback after ssystem is running

discarding policy: routers may prevent congestion by discarding corrupted or less sensitive
packges while mainting quality of message

window policy: protocol should adopt highly selcetive window mechanism like slecte repeat arq
whicih only ressends damaged/lost packets avoiding unncessary duplication cauysed by protolcs
like go back n

ACK policy: receiver should reduce no. of ACK sent bysending singel ACK fofr mulitple packets
or piggybacking as ACKS also add tro netowrk load

Retransmissoin polocy: timers mst be set so that frames arent retransmitted tto qruickly as
unncessary retransmission add to netowrk load and congestion

admission control: in vitraul circuit networks. the swich checks the resouce requierment of new
flow, if resources are insufficent or congestion is likely, router denies establishing virtual
connection

closed loop congestion protocl(removl): bice
principle moniteors netowrk, detects congestion and provides feedback to adjust system opration
,correcting the problem afte rit ahs occured

back pressure: FIG node to node technique for virtual ciruits only
congested node stops accepting packets from immdaite upstream node, forcing congestion backward
until source is warned to slow down

implicit signaling: sourfe guesses hat congestion is occuring based on external symptoms like
not receing ACKS within time out period and slwos donw its rate

choke packet: when router detects utlization exceeding threshold, sands specila choke packet
directyl to source explicityly telling to reduce traffic

explicit signalling: node eexperincing congestion incldes a signal with data packets themselvse
rather than separte chjoke packet to wanr other entites
fprawd signlaing (toi destination) or backward signaling( tosource)

5.
token bus and ring utilize contreol access protocl called token passing which spefial message
called token grants holding station permssion to transmit data

token bus (IEEE 802.4): FIG
physically uses bus/tree topology connected with coax calbles but noedes are logically 
connected in virtual ring
token cirvulates among station follwing sequnce of virtual ring
when sstation receives token, it transmits data
if not data, passes token to next stastion in virtual ring seuqnece

token ring(IEEE 802.5): FIG
physical ring/star topology is used wher trnasmission is unidirectional
satstoin waits for token to arrive, when it captures token, transmits data onto the ring
after transmitting, it releases token to continue circulation to next station, providing
equal access opportunity for all stastion
uses manchester differential encoding
data transfer rate is 14 to 16 mbps
piggybacking
variable sized framing

6.
netowrk traffic analysis:
performance managemtn:monitor various paratamer like resposne time to esnure smooth operatoin of
netweor and guarantee predefined Qof for users
Fault mgmt: detect failures when they happen,isolate failed compopnet and plan for traffic restor
SEcurity and monitoring: aloolw sfiltering of netowrk data (like by proxy servers/firewall)

8.
frame relay					ATM
variable packet size				fixed packet seize
csot is low					costlier
more packet delay				less
less reliable					more erliable
packet transfer speed is less			high
throughput os moderate				high
no error and flow control			yes
used for data trnasmission in WAN		used for transmitting integrated ata,voice idd

proxy serfer is intermediate for client reuqestn diierecting them tro resoucres avlibl form
deifferet sercer (internet)
security: hides clinest internal private IP making netowrk ID anonymous and lyer of secuirty
perofrmance: data caching
monitoring: like firewall for network data monitoring and filtering

mail service: for forwarding and stroign emails

SMPT: FIG
clinet server protocl fro send email from senders client to senders mail server
mail server to mil server acroess intente

POP3: FIG
used by recipients clinet t extract mail from receivers mail server
message is downloaded to local machiane and deleted from server

IMAP: Internet Message Acces Protocol
receive emails, messages are stored and synec on remote server, allowign users to logn in 
and access same mailbox from multipel divsers simultaneouly

10.
clinet query: user tyes domian name in broswer and computer sends querty to DNS resolver
root server: if resolver doesnt have ans, queries to DNS root server
TLD server: root server refers resolver to TLD authoritative server
authoritative server: tld server refers resolver to ANS for specific domain holding needed info

DNS records are info held by AS
contain IP address and other connectivity details for hostname
after DNS resolver finds ip address, it uses to connect to web server
IP adddress is cached bty resovler for future use resultign in non recursive query next time
