1. 
appedning a sequence of redundant bits called CRC bits to end of message so that resulting
message can be exactly divisble by generator polynomial
CRC = 1101
ACtual bit transmitted = 1101011011 1101

app layer is the highest abstraction layer of TCP/IP model that provides interface and protocols
needed by users. it servers as window for application services to access the network and display
reciived information to user

file transfer: allows user to access,retrieve and manage files on a remote computer
mail services: provides the basis for email forwarding and storage facilites
directory services: provides database source access for global infor about various services

DNS is a global syustem for transalting IP address into human readle domain name
required because it is easier to remember domain names (google.com) than their IP address (192.
DNS clients sends requests to server which converts a name (forward DNS lookup) or IP
address (reverse DNS lookup)
DNS implemetns a distributed database to store the naes of all available hosts on internet                    

types of DNS query: rin
-recursive: 
DNS client provides hostname and DNS resolver msut provide answer, relevant reousrce record
or error message if it cant be found
resolver satrts a recursive query process, beginning with DNS root server until it finds the 
authoritative name server that holds the requested information

-iterative:
DNS provides hostname and DNS rewsolver returns best answer it can
if DNS resolver has relevant records in cache, it retunrs
if not, it refers the DNS client to DNS rootr server or another authoritative name server
closeset to required domain zone

-non recursive:
DNS resolver already knows the answer
either iimediately returns a DNS record or quereois DNS NAme server which is authoritative for 
record
in both cases no need for additional round of queies and response immediatly return to client

reason of transition from ipv4 to ipv6:
limited address space:
	2^32 unique address, as internet connected devicse increase, become insufficient

unnecessary and variable header field:
	unused, packet processing slower and complicated for routers

fragmenetation in router
	slows down performance nad increases router load, should be done by sender not routers

addressing model:
	ues class based or NAT(netowrk address translation) based addressing
	inefficient use of IP address and adds complexity to routing

limited Qos:
	ipv4 lacked explicit features for flow labeling and priiorty needed for real time
services like voice/video

NAT:
	limited ips->many devices share one public ip
	breaks end to end connectivity principle of internet 
	complicates application like voip,p2p

broadcast vs multicast:
	caueses unncesary traffic
	multicast not well supported

ipv6 datagram:
	packet of data transmitted over ipv6 network
	version 4: always 6 for ipv6
	traffic class 8: simlair to ipv4 tos, distinguish type of IP datagram
	flow label 20: used to label packets in same flow
	payload length 16: length of payload excluding header
	next header 8: identify next header
	hop limit 8: same as ttl in ipv4, decrements at each router
	source 128: ipv6 sender address
	destination 128: ipv6 receriver address

4.
in connection oriented network service, end to end connection is established between
sender and receiver before transfer of data and is terminated after completion
design is based on telephone system eg TCP

characteristics:
-connection establishment:
	creation of dedicated end to end connection between sender and receriver before trrans

-relaibility:
	more reliable as it guarantees data packet transfer due to authorization called handshaking

-ordering:
	all packets recived in same order they are setn by sender

-phases of communication:
	user follow sequeunce: conn establish,inforamtion send,connection release

requires authentication before transmittind data packets, called handshaking so is more reliable
the order in whic hthe packets are sent by sender is maintained nad received in same order
guarantees data packet transfer
eg tcp

5. spead
MAC is lower sub layer of DLL

-access control:
	provides control for accessing transmission medium
	required when more than 2 devices are connected to common link,determining which device
controls link at any time

-physical addressing:
	adds physical(MAC) address of sender and reciever in header of each frame

-data movement:
	responsible for moving data packets from one network interface to another across shared
transmission

-encapsulation:
	when sending data, it encapsulates higher level frames into frames appropriate for
transmission medium

-specific access methods:
	defines specific access methods for different LANs
	CSMA/CD fro ethernet LANS nad token passing for token ring/bus LANs
	deals with actual control of media
	
6.
Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a network acrchitectrue for accelerating serivce
deplyoment for netowrk operatoers and reduce the cost by seprating functions like firewall,
routers and load balancers which have traditionally been rn on dedicated commputer hardware

-cost reduction: 
	purchasing software on satndard servers instead of expensive dedicated network equipment

-increased efficeiny:
	efifcent in space,pwoer,cooling compared to proppiretary hardware solution

-faster deployment:
	faster time to deploy network services

-flexibility and saclabiilty:
	flexibilty, elasticc slace up and down capacity

-hardware independence:
	supports infrastructure independent from hardware
	allows netowkr operatos to implement netowrk [plciy without worrying about hardware
placement or traffic routign through specific functions
	provides new way to create, distribute and mange netweork devices/services using
virtual software based applications

8. 
web server vs proxy server:
hosts websites and responds to HTTP requests	ACts as intermediary machine, translating traffic
from clinets, serving web content		between eotwrks/protocls, separting end user clinet 
						destinations
location is destinatoin where web content is	sits between clinet and external netwrok(froward
stored						proxy) or betweeen netowrk and internal resource
						(revers eproxy)
delivers web apges to clients			controls internet usage, manage bandwidth,
						provides privacy benefits, improves security, 
						provicdes access to blockde resources
seraches for requested page, if found, sends	evaluates outbound requests, caces data to speed
to client via HTTP response			up common requests, hides clinests IP adress

9.
traffic shaping algorithm to control rate of traffic sent into netwrok helping to smooth out
bursty traffid and ensure network stability
iamgeine a bucket that holdfs tockens. tokesns are genrated and addesd to bucket at fixexd rate
(r tokens/sec). to transmit a packet of size n, sender must remove n tokens from bucket.
if enough tokens are availblae in bucket, packet is sent immediately else packet is either
dealyaed until enough tokens accumuilate or discarded. bucket has max acapity B. if token
generation rate exceeds capacity, extra tokens are discarded, meanign the bucket sets a limit
on aomunt of burstiness allowed

10.
PPP is internet protocol used for router to router traffic ad home user to isp traffic

-packet framing: encapsulates NL datagrams into DLL frame
-multi protocol support: can carry NL data from any NL protocol and has bility top demultiplex 
	data upwards
-bit transparency: msut be able to cary any bit pattern in data field
-error detection: error detection but not correction
-connection liveness: can detect and signal link failure to NL
-authentication: permits user identificatoin

11.
use radio wave of different frequncies and dont need wire to transmit signals

radio waves:
	3kHz-1Ghz
	omnidirectional
	penetrate ttherough walls easily, suitable for indorr and outdoor communication
	used in AM FM radio. TV,Wifi,cell phone

micro wave:
	1-300Ghz
	unidirectional, needs LOS,prevents interference with ohter aligned antenna pairs
	used for PPP communcaiton

12a.
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
used for error reporting and diagnostic fucntion in IP network
not sending user data between systems but sending control messgaes realted to netowrk operations
ICMP message include fileds like TYpe and Code to specify nature of message and checksum for 
error checking
