reason of transition from ipv4 to ipv6:
limited address space:
	2^32 unique address, as internet connected devicse increase, become insufficient

unnecessary and variable header field:
	unused, packet processing slower and complicated for routers

fragmenetation in router
	slows down performance nad increases router load, should be done by sender not routers

addressing model:
	ues class based or NAT based addressing
	inefficient use of IP address and adds complexity to routing

NAT:
	limited ips->many devices share one public ip
	breaks end to end connectivity principle of internet 
	complicates application like voip,p2p

broadcast vs multicast:
	caueses unncesary traffic
	multicast not well supported

QOS:
	no effective support for real time services lke voice/vidioe

ipv6 datagram:
	packet of data transmitted over ipv6 network
	version 4: always 6 for ipv6
	traffic class 8: simlair to ipv4 tos
	flow label 20: used to label packets in same flow
	payload length 16: length of payload excluding header
	next header 8: identify next header
	hop limit 8: same as ttl in ipv4, decrements at each router
	source 32: sender address
	destination 32: receriver address

in connection oriented network service, end to end connection is established between
sender and receiver before transfer of data and is terminated after completion
requires authentication before transmittind data packets, called handshaking so is more reliable
the order in whic hthe packets are sent by sender is maintained nad received in same order
guarantees data packet transfer
eg tcp

5.
provides control for accessing transmission medium
moves packets from one network medium to another across shared transmision medium
handles physical addressing
when sending data ato another device, encapsulates higher level frames into frames
appropirate for transmission medium
deals with actuial control of media
