function of network layer: fliprn
routing:
	when packet arrives at router, it checks where it needs to go and send it out through
correct path. Example: if a packet is going from S1 to S2, router R1 forwards it to next stop
on the way to S2

logical addressing:
	this layer givse each device a unique logical address(like IP addresS) to distinguish
source and destiantion. it adds both sender and reciever logical address in packet header,

internetworking:
	it logically connects different types of netowrks aloowing the m to communicate 
as if htey were part of one big netowkr

fragmentatio and reassembly:
	if a packet is too large to sand all at once, it breaks it into smaller pieces
which are rejoined correctly at receiver;s end

packetizing:
	it encapsualktes data into packets for efficeint rtansmission

netowrk address translation(NAT):
	map private IP address used in home/comapny to public IP address used on internet.
It conserves IP addresses and adds security.

ip addressing:
	ip address is a numerical label assigned to each deivce connected to a netork
using IP for communcation. its function are:
	identification: identifies the device on the network
	location addressing: specifies where device is lcoated

ipv4:
	32 bit address
	4 decimal numbers separated by .
	total ipv4 = 2^32
	range is 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
	types: unicast, multicast, broadcast

class A 0: 8 bits network 24 host, total networks=2^7 - 2(0invalid,127loopback), total host=2^24
class B 10: 16 bits network 16 host,total networks=2^14, total host=2^16 
class C 110: 24 bits network 8 hosttotal networks=2^21, total host=2^8 
class D 110: multicast
class E 1111: future use

ipv6:
	128 bit address
	8 hexadecimal numbers seprated by :
	total ipv6 = 2^128
	types: unicast, multicast, anycast

network address:
	netowrk part of ip address that represts entire netowk
	consists of network firled and all 0 in host part of address
	not a usable host IP
	only used by routers to decide hwo to get packets to their destination

broadcast address:
	address used to send message to all hosts in same network
	consists of netowrk field and all 1 in host part of address
	not usable host IP

loopback address:
	private address for diagnostic testing of devices
	class A 127.0.0.0 network address reserved for loopback testing
	127.0.0.1 is used to test if NIC card is sending and receiving signals

subnet mask:
	32 bit address that teslls devices which part of ip address is network and host
	consists of 1 in network field 0 in host field
	deafult subnet mask:
	class A:255.0.0.0 or /8
	class B:255.255.0.0 or /16
	class C:255.255.255.0 or /24

subnetting:
	process of dividing large netowrk into smaller manageable sub-netowrks 
	divide class a b c network address into smaller networks with own network address
	each subnet acts as its own LAN and is connected to own router interface
	use:
		efficient IP address utlizlaition
		improved secuirty and performance
		reducing braodcast traffic

flsm: all subnets have same no. of host
vlsm: subnets have different size based on need for efficient ip usage

classless inter domain routing(cidr):
	no fixed classes
	uses prefix length /24 /16 to define network and host part
	feature:
		efficinet ip usage
		flexible, we can divide and assign blocks as neede
		used for subnet and superet

ipv4 datagram:
	packet of data transmitted over ipv4 network
	version 4: always 4 for ipv4
	header length 4: determines where in ip datagram data actually begings
	type of service 4: distinguish types of ip datagram 
	datagram length(bytes) 16: total length of datagram (header+datagram)
	16 bit identifier, flags, 13 bit fragmentation offset: identify fragments of same datgram
	time to live 8: ensure datagram dont circulate forever in network, ttl=0 apcket discard
	upper layer portocol 8: tells ip layer which upper layer protocol(tcp,udp,icmp) should
		 handle payload
	header checksum 16: detect error that may occur in header
	32 bit source ip:
	32 bit destination ip:
	options(if any): identify several additional srevices, not used in every datagam
	data: conatins user data

ipv6 datagram:
	version 4: always 6 for ipv6
	traffic class 6: simlair to ipv4 tos
	flow label 20: used to label packets in same flow
	payload length 16: length of payload excluding header
	next header 8: identify next header
	hop limit 8: same as ttl in ipv4, decrements at each router
	source 32:
	destination 32:
