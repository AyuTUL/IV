classful addressing is a system that divides ipv4 address space into fixxed size class
each class has predetermined defauilt subnet mask and range

A 0:range, default subent mask 255.0.0.0/8, unicast, 0 and 127(loopback address for diagnostic 
testing) reserved
B 10: range, 255.255.0.0/16, unicast
C 110: range, 255.255.255.0/24, unicast
D 1110: range, multicast
E 1111: range, experimental use

Link State Routing:
dynamic router that overcomes scalabitliy isseus of distance vector routing
dijkstra/SPF
eg: OSPF, IS-IS

mechanism:
full topology knowledge:mainstains complex database with full netowrk topology withing its area
unlike DV which is based on info exhance between neighbours
LSA: routesr exchange topology updates in small packets called LSA. udpates are incremental
and event triggered(not periodic) for faster convergence
independenmt calc: each router compiles LSA into topoogical database
calculates shortest path from itself to all other destination
SPF algorithm: uses dijkstra algorithm on database to determine optimal apth, ersulting in SPF tree

DLL feature
flow control restricts amount of data that sender can transmit before waiting for ack
to snsure flow of data doesnt overwhelm receiver and data loss

stop and wait ARQ protocol FIG
flow ocntrol mechanism in noisy channel
ARQ means when frame is los sender tretnasrsmits it
sender side:
sender maintains time out clokc which is srated when single frame is sent
then waits for ACK from receiver
if sender receives ACK, it esnds next frame

receiver side:
receiver processes frame
if frame is received correctly reutrns ACK with sequence no. of nesxt expected frame
if damaged, discards damged frame andsends NACK with sequence no. of damaged frame

sender case receives no ACK/NACK :
if no any ACK is rrecived, afte time out clock expires, sender assumes frame or ACK is lost
retransmits frame
waits for ACK from receiver

sender case receives NACK:
retransmits only damaged frame

low transmission rate due tioi waiting for every single ACK
waiting period means bandwith is wasted
inefficint for high latency netowrk

3.
TCP datagram format:
source port 16: holds port number of source app to identify transmitting app
dest port 16: holds port number of refeiving app to send data to appropriate app at destinatoin
sequence number 32: ensure data is receied in proper order by ordergin segemts and reassembly
ACK number 32: contains upcomding SN, acknowledgeing feedback upto that point
data offset 4: indicates starting point of TCP payload and stores size of TCP header
control falg 9: regulates communcation (SYN for conn,ACK for ack,Fin for termin,RST for reset)
window size 16: specifesi size of senders receive window for lfow control
checksum 16: reveals if haeder/segment was damaged during transportation
urgent pointer 16: points to packets first byte of urgent data
options variable: represent diffrent TCP otion
data variable: contains app dat qabeing transmitted 

-reliable service:
	guarantees data delivery using flow control(sender controlled by receiver window size)
and error control mechanisms(acknowledgement/transmission)

-stream delivery:
	handles data as a stream of bytes, ensuring ordered segmenting and reassembly

-applications:
	used by protocols requiring high reliabiilty like HTTP,HTTPS,FTP,SMTP

4.
network toppology is physical arrangement fo computers,cables and other componesnts on a network
affteciong speed and performance

-bus:
	all computers are attached to continous calbe(backbone) in a linear format
	simple,less expensive,easy to add new nodes\
	heavy traffic slows performance, difficult to troubleshoot,if backbone fails whole netowo

-star:
	all cables rubn from computer to central connecting device hub/swtich
	easy to setup,single computer failre doesnt fail whole netowrk,easy error detection
	if central device fail,whole netowrk stops,costs mroe to cable

-ring:
	each computer is connected to next qith last connected to firwst formign a ring
	info travels in one direction(clock/anti)
	easy to setup,equal chance for all computers to access resources,single cable conn
between nodes
	failure of one computer affects whole netowrk,adding/removing netowrk distrubs neetowk,
difficult to troubleshoot

-mesh:
	each node is linked to others thorugh intermediate nodes with redudandant paths
	all nodse are directly conncete to one another
	wires requied is n(n-1)/2
	fault tolerance,easy to trobubleshoot
	difficult to intall,exenseive

-tree:
	combo of star and bus topology, structured like branches in a treww
	high scalability(leaf nodes can add more nodes),easy maintenance and fault identifica
	requies large no of calbes,expenseive

-hybrid:
	combo of more than 2 topologies, inheriting the adv and disadv of included topologies
	combines benifits,highly reliable,used for large network
	complex design,expensive,diffcult to isntall

circuit swiotjcing techinque for long distance c ommunction by establishing dedicated connectoin
bewteen sender and receiver
eg: tcp, telephone call
FIGss
connection establishment: request signal is sent,ACK is returned and path is established,takes times
info transfer: data flws in fixed cirvuit at constate rate
connection terminatoin: paht is realeased after transmiion is comlete

adv:
-dedicated channel ensures reliable bandwisdth throughtout the session
-suitable for real time apps like voice call since data arrives in correct oredr withou delay
-desont require error control since no data loss after conn estrablishment

disadv:
-if pah is connceted but no data is transfeered, bandiwth is wasted
-since deicated, no other data can be transferred even if channel is free
-establishing connection takes time
-expenseive due to reserving resource

LLC:
interface netween MAC and NL
suncrhonization,error control,flow control
defined by IEEE 803.2
provides logic for data link
identifies which network protocl is being used

HDLC:

unicast						multicast
sends packet from 1 send to 1 reciever		1 sender to multiple seelcted receivers
one to one type communication			one to many
one packet per destination			one packet sent once, duplicated by routers when
						needed
uses unicast ip address class ABC		multicast IP address class D
routing table contains entries for each destn	maintains multicast group membership info
diercet packet delivery to single IP		packet relpciation at routers to reach group
web browsing,file transder			streaming media to muktipel devices simultaneou

8.
port address is 16 bit numerical albel assigned to specifi process(app) running on a host,
defining where ata should be deliered once it reaches destination device
socket address is combo of ip adrerss and port number, uniquely identifes host along with
netweokring application running in that host, acting as single endpoint for communincation

leaky buceklt algorithm: FIG
traffic shaping algorthim to regulate data ouptut at constant rate

incoming data packets are stored in a fixed size queue acting as bucket
packtes are removed from queue and transmitte at constant fixed rate r
this smooths out any burts of incoming traffic
if rate of incoming traffic exceeds capacity of queue, excess packets are discarded

9.
DNs is global system used for translating IP address into human readable domain name vice versa
phone book of internet

FTP FIG
stadard Internet proteocol based on clent server model for transmitting files between
computers over TCP/IP conenctions
ueses 2 separte communication channels:
-control channel: TCP port 21 for commands and responsesm, remaining open throught session
-data channel: TCP port 20 for transferring file content, opened and clseod for each file trnfer
clinets can upload,download,delte,rename and copy files on a server

SFTP
secure shell FTP
operates over sercure encrypted SSH connection
protects against man in the middle attacks, aiuthtenticates both user and server,data integrity

ipv4 is 32 bit adsdressing scheme for uniqiuely identify devices connected to network
identification- idenitfy device on newtork
llcoation addressing-specfiy where device is located
written as 4 decimal numbers separted by dots
2^32 unique address divied into classes ABCDE
address is split into netowrk and host portion
supports unicast,multicast,broadcast address types
due to limited adderss space, NAT required ro conserger public IP

infrared is wireless transmission media for short range communcation
freeunce is 300GHz-400Thz
cant penetrate walls, require los
prevents intereferecne between systems in adjacent rooms like remote controls
cant be used outside since sun ray also contin infrared which interfere with ocmms
