1.
classful addressing is a system that divides ipv4 address space into fixxed size class
each class has predetermined defauilt subnet mask and range

A 0:range, default subent mask 255.0.0.0/8, unicast, 0 and 127 reserved
B 10: range, 255.255.0.0/16, unicast
C 110: range, 255.255.255.0/24, unicast
D 1110: range, multicast
E 1111: range, experimental use

2.
flow control restricts amount of data that sender can transmit before waiting for ack
to snsure flow of data doesnt overwhelm receiver

stop and wait ARQ protocol is error control protocol used for realiable data transmission
in noisy channel
sender sends single frame to receiver and starts timer. if receiver succesfully recives frame,
 it sends ACK with sequence no. of next frame to sender for confirmation. sender sends next frame
if snder doesnt receive ACK withint time frame, it assumes frame has been lost and retransmits
duplicate frame is discarded at receiver side
if receiver doesnt receive frame then it sends NACK to sender and sender retransmits

low transmission rate
waiting period means bandwith is wasted

3.
TCP datagram format:
source port 12: holds port number of source app to identify transmitting app
dest port 16: holds port number of refeiving app to send data to appropriate app
sequence number 32: ensure data is receied in proper order by ordergin segemts
ACK number 32: contains upcomding SN, acknowledgeing feedback upto that point
data offset 4: indicates starting point of TCP payload and stores size of TCP header
control falg 9: regulates communcation (SYN for conn,ACK for ack,Fin for termin,RST for reset)
window size 16: specifesi size of senders receive window for lfow control
checksum 16: reveals if haeder/segment was damaged during transportation
urgent pointer 16: points to packets first byte of urgent data
options variable: represent diffrent TCP otion
data variable: contains app dat qabeing transmitted 

-reliable service:
	guarantees data delivery using flow control(sender controlled by receiver window size)
and error control mechanisms(acknowledgement/transmission)

-stream delivery:
	handles data as a stream of bytes, ensuring ordered segmenting and reassembly

-applications:
	used by protocols requiring high reliabiilty like HTTP,HTTPS,FTP,SMTP

4.
network toppology is physical arrangement fo computers,cables and other componesnts on a network
affteciong speed and performance

-bus:
	all computers are attached to continous calbe(backbone) in a linear format
	simple,less expensive,easy to add new nodes\
	heavy traffic slows performance, difficult to troubleshoot,if backbone fails whole netowo

-star:
	all cables rubn from computer to central connecting device hub/swtich
	easy to setup,single computer failre doesnt fail whole netowrk,easy error detection
	if central device fail,whole netowrk stops,costs mroe to cable

-ring:
	each computer is connected to next qith last connected to firwst formign a ring
	info travels in one direction(clock/anti)
	easy to setup,equal chance for all computers to access resources,single cable conn
between nodes
	failure of one computer affects whole netowrk,adding/removing netowrk distrubs neetowk,
difficult to troubleshoot

-mesh:
	each node is linked to others thorugh intermediate nodes with redudandant paths
	all nodse are directly conncete to one another
	wires requied is n(n-1)/2
	fault tolerance,easy to trobubleshoot
	difficult to intall,exenseive

-tree:
	combo of star and bus topology, structured like branches in a treww
	high scalability(leaf nodes can add more nodes),easy maintenance and fault identifica
	requies large no of calbes,expenseive

-hybrid:
	combo of more than 2 topologies, inheriting the adv and disadv of included topologies
	combines benifits,highly reliable,used for large network
	complex design,expensive,diffcult to isntall
