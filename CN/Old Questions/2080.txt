packet siwtching is swithcign techqniue for long distance comms in whichi messagfe is divied
into smllaer unieauly nunbermed packets
packets are trnasmitted individually across network, tkaing shortrstest availble path
packets are reassembled at destination in correct order

adv:
efficiet bandwidth use as multipe suers can use same chnnal simultaniely
reliably as if intermidate node is busy, aockets canb be dynamically rerouted
csot effective as doestn requiere secodnary storage like in message switching

disadv:
variable delay(jitteR) as packets may travel different routes and arrive out of order
overhead: packet need heade with sourfe,dest addres and sequnce number ,inefificent for small
