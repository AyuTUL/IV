heuristic search:
Heuristic search is an informed search technique that uses problem-specific knowledge
 (called heuristics) to find the most promising path to a goal state.
It helps reduce the number of nodes explored compared to uninformed methods (like BFS or DFS).

acting humanly: the turing test approach
the turing test by alan turing is a test in which a program has to conversate with a human
interrogator for 5 minutes. the interrogator poses written questions to program and if
he cant tell if the response is from a computer or a person for more than 30% of the time
, program passes the test.
the program msut contain following capabilites:
	natural language processing: to communicate in english
	knowledge representaion: to store what it knows/hears
	automated reasoning: to store info and draw new conclusiopn
	machien learning: to addapt to new circumstance and detect extrapolate patterns
eg: chatbots that mimic human conversation

simplex reflex agent:
acts based only on curretn percept and ignores rest of percpt history
uses condition action rules; if condition is true perfor maction else not
suited for fully observalbe environemnt
eg: vacuum cleaner that turns left when it hits a wall
fig: sensors->what the world is like now->what action I should do now->actuators
					condtiion action rules

model based agent:
uses model of the world to update knowledge nad make decisions
maintains internal state(memory of past percepts) to keep track of environemtn
updating state requires knowledge about how world evolves independently from agent and how
agent's actions affect hw world
this knowledge is called model of the world
suitable for partially observable environemnt
eg: thermostat that rememebrs past temperatures and acts accordginoy
fig: sensors->what the world is like now->what action i should do now->actuators
state	how the world evolves	what my actions do	condition action rules

goal based agent:
uses goal info to select one maong multiple possiblities to reach desired state
goal info means states that are desirable
requires seraching and planning to determine how to achieve goals
decision making involes consideration of futrue not only current state iof environemnt
eg: pathfinding robot aiming to reach destination
fig:what the world is like now->what it will be like if i do action a->what action i should do now
state	how the world evolves	what myt actions do			goals

utlilty based agent:
usue utilty function to measur epreference among multipel goals since goals alone arent enough
to generate high quality behaviour in msot environemnts
utility describes how happy the agent is
it refers and compares better outcomes among serveral ways to reach a goal
eg: delivary drone that selects route with best baklacne of speed,safety,battery usage
fig: what the world is like now->what it willl be like if i do action a->how happy i will be 
in such a state->what action i should do now
state	how the world evolves	what my actions do	utility

belief network:
probablistix grpah model for represneting knowledge about uncertain domain where each node
corresponds t oa random varaible and each edge represnts conditional probability for
corresponding prorbaility for corresponding random vraibles.

min max algorithm in game search:
used in 2 plyer zero sum game like chess and tic tac toe where one player tries to maximaize
the outcome and other tries to minimize it assuming opponent plays optimally.
itts steps are:
	generate full game tree uptyo terminal states
	assign utility values to terminal states
	propagae valeus bottom up where
		min nodes take min value of children
		max nodes take ma value of children
