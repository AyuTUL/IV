heuristic search:
Heuristic search is an informed search technique that uses problem-specific knowledge
 (called heuristics) to find the most promising path to a goal state.
It helps reduce the number of nodes explored compared to uninformed methods (like BFS or DFS).

acting humanly: the turing test approach
the turing test by alan turing is a test in which a program has to conversate with a human
interrogator for 5 minutes. the interrogator poses written questions to program and if
he cant tell if the response is from a computer or a person for more than 30% of the time
, program passes the test.
the program msut contain following capabilites:
	natural language processing: to communicate in english
	knowledge representaion: to store what it knows/hears
	automated reasoning: to store info and draw new conclusiopn
	machien learning: to addapt to new circumstance and detect extrapolate patterns
eg: chatbots that mimic human conversation

simplex reflex agent:
acts based only on curretn percept and ignores rest of percpt history
uses condition action rules; if condition is true perfor maction else not
suited for fully observalbe environemnt
eg: vacuum cleaner that turns left when it hits a wall
fig: sensors->what the world is like now->what action I should do now->actuators
					condtiion action rules

model based agent:
uses model of the world to update knowledge nad make decisions
maintains internal state(memory of past percepts) to keep track of environemtn
updating state requires knowledge about how world evolves independently from agent and how
agent's actions affect hw world
this knowledge is called model of the world
suitable for partially observable environemnt
eg: thermostat that rememebrs past temperatures and acts accordginoy
fig: sensors->what the world is like now->what action i should do now->actuators
state	how the world evolves	what my actions do	condition action rules

goal based agent:
uses goal info to select one maong multiple possiblities to reach desired state
goal info means states that are desirable
requires seraching and planning to determine how to achieve goals
decision making involes consideration of futrue not only current state iof environemnt
eg: pathfinding robot aiming to reach destination
fig:what the world is like now->what it will be like if i do action a->what action i should do now
state	how the world evolves	what myt actions do			goals

utlilty based agent:
usue utilty function to measur epreference among multipel goals since goals alone arent enough
to generate high quality behaviour in msot environemnts
utility describes how happy the agent is
it refers and compares better outcomes among serveral ways to reach a goal
eg: delivary drone that selects route with best baklacne of speed,safety,battery usage
fig: what the world is like now->what it willl be like if i do action a->how happy i will be 
in such a state->what action i should do now
state	how the world evolves	what my actions do	utility

NLP processe:
-tokenization: input text is broken down into smaller units called tokens like word,setece

-lexical analysis: tokesn are processed and assigend to crorecpoinding entries in dictionary
idntifying parts of speech for each toke nlike noun verb prnoun

-syntactic analyssis: tokes are analyzed for grammatical srtucutre
cheking if input follow grammar of language and dieitnfying each word's role resulting in
parse tree represetnation

-semantci analysis: dervies meaning of sentence
converts syntactical strcuture into meningful repsenation and ensure aligns with correct contrxt
ie word snes disambiguation

-discourse integration:understanding larges chukns of txt
ensure sentences are logically connected. meaning of curretn sentcne my depend of prveis

-pragmatic analysis: intended meanign of text based on extranl contrxt seaokrs intenit
ultizing real world knoweldge

belief network:
probablistix grpah model for represneting knowledge about uncertain domain where each node
corresponds t oa random varaible and each edge represnts conditional probability for
corresponding prorbaility for corresponding random vraibles.

expert system:
computer progarm that uses ai to solve problems within speacilzard domain
taht oridnarliy reuiesr human expertise
designed to provde desgino making ability like huma nexpert

componenets:
knowledge base: problem solving,support component
-core klnowlede of system like gfacts adn regulations releveant to domain algon with
rules for problem solving
-knowledge is stored in for of if then rules
-as more knowledge is stored in kb, performance of syste increases

inference engine:
-core engine that acts as control mechanism
-gahter relevant information from knowledge base,analze it and identidfy soution to user sissue
-aaplies logical reasoning like backward/forward chainging to match facts with rules and deduce
new info

knowledge acuisition adn learnign module:
-enables expert system to gather knowledge from variosu sources like human experts,textbooks
and faciliteates transfer of that knowledge into kb

UI:
-comm bridge between non expert user and expert system
-accepts input queries from user and disaplays result derived by ssytem

explanation module:
-provides user with justification for conclusion reached by system.exaplning reasoinng stesps
taken by inference engine
-for transparency and user trust

naive bayes modeL;
supervised learning algorithm used to solve classification problems 
based on bayes theorm and predicts coutomces based on probabilites

working mechanism:
-bayes theorem:
uses bayes theorem to calculate posterior probablity using conditional proablity
P(H/E)=P(E/H).P(H)/P(E)
where 
	P(H/E): posteriror
	P(E/H): likelihood
	P(H): prior
	P(E): marginal

-naive assumption:
makes the fundametanl assumption taht all featuers involved are independet of one another
eg: if predicting whether a fruit is apple based on color,shape,tastse, naive assumes that
color contributes to classificaiton independtly of shape feature

-process: FIG
convert data set into frequcny table->create likelihood table(probabilit of feautre)->
use bayes theorem to calculate posteriro probablity

min max algorithm in game search:
used in 2 plyer zero sum game like chess and tic tac toe where one player tries to maximaize
the outcome and other tries to minimize it assuming opponent plays optimally.
itts steps are:
	generate full game tree uptyo terminal states
	assign utility values to terminal states
	propagae valeus bottom up where
		min nodes take min value of children
		max nodes take ma value of children
