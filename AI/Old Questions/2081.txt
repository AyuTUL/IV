skolemizatio:
step in converting fopl formula into cluase form by eliminating existentail quantifiers. it is
done by:
-Replacing ∃x with a Skolem constant if it's not inside any universal quantifier.
-If ∃x is within the scope of ∀y, replace x with a Skolem function: f(y).

skolen constant:
special constant used in skolemization, a process in fopl that removes esitenctial quntifiier
(∃) by introducing new constants/functions that represnet a particular but unspecified object

steps of resolution using skolemization:
-Convert all statements into First-Order Predicate Logic (FOPL).
-Move all quantifiers to the front (Prenex Normal Form).
-Skolemize to eliminate ∃ using Skolem constants/functions.
-Drop universal quantifiers (assumed in clause form).
-Convert to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
-Apply resolution rule to derive new facts or contradictions.

uninformed vs informed search:
no domain specific knowledge			uses problem specific heuristics
bfs dfs uniform cost search			greedy best first a* hill climbing
heuristics not used				heuristics used
less efficient as exploring blindly		more efficient guided by heristic values
complete					not always complete 

intelligence:
ability to percieve, le arn, reason,adapt and make decisions to solve problems or acheive
goalss in a dynamic environment

script:
structured knowledge representation that describes a stereotyped sequence of events in particular
context. it uses fram like structure to repsent commonly occcuring expreiences

components of script:
1. entry condition: conditions that must be satisfied before execution of script can occur
2. results: conditions that will be true after exit
3. props: objects involed in script
4. roles: people involed in script and expected actions of major participants
5. track: specifies particular position of script
6. scenes: sequence of events fowlloing a genral default path

script of visiting doctor in hospital:

Script: Visiting a Doctor

  Track: Visinting ENT specialitst

  Roles:
    - Patient
    - Receptionist
    - Doctor

  Props:
    - Appointment card
    - Waiting room
    - Prescription
    - Medical report

  Entry Conditions:
    - Patient is feeling unwell

  Scenes:
    1. Patient arrives at the clinic
    2. Registers at the reception
    3. Waits in the waiting room
    4. Goes in when name is called
    5. Describes symptoms to the doctor
    6. Doctor examines the patient
    7. Doctor writes a prescription or orders tests
    8. Patient leaves the clinic

  Result:
    - Patient receives diagnosis and treatment plan

fuzzy logic:
form of many valued logic in which truth valkues of variables may be real number from 0 to 1
handles concept of partial truth
mathematical way of repsenting vagueness/imprecise information

minmax algorithm in game search:
used in 2 player adversarial games to simulate all possible move and slecet the move that
maximezes player's minimum gain, assuming opponent playsa optimally

step 1:
algorith generates enitre game tree
apply utility function to get utiliy value for terminal states
A is intial state
maximiser has worst case initila value - infinity
minimiser has wort case intila value + infinty

step 2:
find utility value for minimizer
copmare inital value and terminal state value and min will go to higher node

step 3:
find utility value for maximizer
copmare inital value and terminal state value and max will go to higher node
