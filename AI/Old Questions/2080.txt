cnf conversion rules:
Eliminate implications
Example: A → B becomes ¬A ∨ B

Move negations inward (using De Morgan's laws)
Example: ¬(A ∧ B) becomes ¬A ∨ ¬B

Standardize variables (rename to avoid confusion)

Skolemize (eliminate existential quantifiers using Skolem constants/functions)

Drop universal quantifiers (assumed by default in CNF)

Distribute ∨ over ∧ to get conjunctive normal form
Example: (A ∨ (B ∧ C)) becomes (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C)

properties of ai agent:
ineternal:

	goal oruiented: infuels environemnt to achieve well definded ohjectives
external:
	communication: interact with umans/ai agent in environemnt to complete task
	cooperation: collab with other agenst for problems exceed cacpaiblity of single agent
	mobility: can move across electronic comm network
