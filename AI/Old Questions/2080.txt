cnf conversion rules:
Eliminate implications
Example: A → B becomes ¬A ∨ B

Move negations inward (using De Morgan's laws)
Example: ¬(A ∧ B) becomes ¬A ∨ ¬B

Standardize variables (rename to avoid confusion)

Skolemize (eliminate existential quantifiers using Skolem constants/functions)

Drop universal quantifiers (assumed by default in CNF)

Distribute ∨ over ∧ to get conjunctive normal form
Example: (A ∨ (B ∧ C)) becomes (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C)

properties of ai agent:
ineternal: larg
	learning/reasoning: learns from apst expreiences and adapts
	rectivity: responds approporitaly to environmental changes
	autonomy: act sindependtly, controls its own states and decisions
	goal oruiented: infuels environemnt to achieve well definded ohjectives
external: mccc
	communication: interact with umans/ai agent in environemnt to complete task
	cooperation: collab with other agenst for problems exceed cacpaiblity of single agent
	mobility: can move across electronic comm network
	character: imitate human like behaviour

selection: FIG
process of choosing 2 parents from population for crossing and reproduction for offspring
all selected individuals are arranged in a pair of twos to increase reproduction
these individuals transfer genes to next generation

-roulette wheel/fitness proportionate selection: 
 probabilitis selction that assigns probabiltiy of selection to each individual on the basis
of fitness, higher fitness more chance to get selected

-tournament selection:
running several tournaments among few individuals randomly chosen from population
winner of each tournament ie highest fitness is selected for next generation

-rank based selection:
assings selcetion probablity based on rank of individual's fitness rather than fitness itself
by sprting popuplation by fitness

reproduction:
2 bvariation operators are applied to parent population to create child

-crossover:
process of taking 2 parent solutions and prodcuing child
reproduction operator selects a random pair of 2 individuals for mating
cross site is selected at random along string length
position values are swapped between 2 strings following cross site

--single point crossover
2 mating chormosomes are cut once at coressponding points and sections after the cuts are exchanged
crossover point is selected at random

--2 point crossover
2 crossover points are chosen on parent chromosomes then segment between these points are
swapped to reate offspring

--livery/uniform crossover
each gene in offpsring is independent ly chosen from either parent with equal probability

--inheritable genetic algorithm:
cetrain genes are inherited by offspriong to ensure high quality solution
balance preservation with exploration - controlled diversity

-mutation:
mutation operator inserts random genes in offspring to maintain diversity in population
fliiping bits in chromosomes
solves problem of premature convergence and enchances diversification

--flip bit mutation:
a parent is chosen and mutation chromosome is randomly generated
for a 1 in mutation chromosome, coresspondign bit in parrent is flipped to  create child

--gaussian mutation:
addign random value drawn from gaussian distribution to individuals gene values

--exchange/swap mutation:
2 positions in chromosome are randomly selected and exchanged to create new individual

expert system:
computer progarm that uses ai to solve problems within speacilzard domain
taht oridnarliy reuiesr human expertise
designed to provde desgino making ability like huma nexpert

componenets:
knowledge base: problem solving,support component
-core klnowlede of system like gfacts adn regulations releveant to domain algon with
rules for problem solving
-knowledge is stored in for of if then rules
-as more knowledge is stored in kb, performance of syste increases

inference engine:
-core engine that acts as control mechanism
-gahter relevant information from knowledge base,analze it and identidfy soution to user sissue
-aaplies logical reasoning like backward/forward chainging to match facts with rules and deduce
new info

knowledge acuisition adn learnign module:
-enables expert system to gather knowledge from variosu sources like human experts,textbooks
and faciliteates transfer of that knowledge into kb

UI:
-comm bridge between non expert user and expert system
-accepts input queries from user and disaplays result derived by ssytem

explanation module:
-provides user with justification for conclusion reached by system.exaplning reasoinng stesps
taken by inference engine
-for transparency and user trust
