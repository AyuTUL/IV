1.
state space graph:
representation of set of all possible staes in a problem domain and the transionts between them
due to actions
nodes repsent possible stes of problem
edges represnte actions that take agent from oen state to another
start node respetns intial sate
goal node sreprseents desired state
each edge may have cost

S:[S,A,Action(s),Result(s,a),Cost(s,a)]
S: set of all possible states
A: set of all possible actions
Action(s): which action can be performed in state s
Result(s,a): returns state reached after performing action a in state s
Cost(s,a): returns cost of performing action a in state s

gbfs vs a*:
chooses best possible path at current state	chooses most promising path
eval function f(n)=h(n)				eval function f(n)=h(n)+g(n)	
h(n): cost from node n to goal			g(n): cost from start node to node n
not optimal, ignores g(n) and misses cheapest	if h(n) is admissible h(n)<=h*(n)
path						consistent h(n)<=c(n,m)+h(m)
not complete, stuck in infite loops		complete if branching factor is finite and cost
						of every action is fixed
time complexity: O(b^m)				O(b^d) 
space complexity: O(b^m)			O(b^d)
m: max depth of search space			b: brnching factor
						d: depth of solution

a* search:
informed search algorithm that ues info about path cost and heuristics to find shortest
path between nodes
	f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
where,
	f(n): estimated cost of cheapest solution
	g(n): cost to reach node n from start state
	h(N): cost to reach from node n to goal node

algorithm:
step 1:
	define list OPEN
	initially, open constist of start node S

step 2:
	if list is empty, return failure and exit

step 3:
	remove node n with smallest value of fn) from OPEN and move it to list CLOSED
	if node n is goal state, reutrn success and exit

step 4:
 	expand node n

step 5:
	if any succsor to n is goal node, reutrn success and obtain soluition by tracing path
	form goal node to S
	else goto step ^

step 6:
	for each succesor node, aplly evaluation function f to node
	if node hasnt been in either list, add it to OPEN

step 7:
	goto step 2

properties of A*:
optimality: guarantedd to find best possible solutiopn 
a* is optimal if:
	admissible: h(n) is admissible if it never overestimate sreal distance between n and goal
		h(n)<=h*(n)
	where
		h*(n):real distance between n and goal node

	consistency: h(n) is consistent i festimate is <= estimated distance between n and 
neighbout + cost of reaching that neightbour
		h(n)<=c(n,m)+h(m)
	where,
		c(n,m):distance between nodes n and m

completeness: if solution to problem exists, it is guaranteed to find it
a* is complete if:
	branching factor is finitr
	cost at every action is fixed

combo of bfs and dfs
we expand node that is closest to goal node and its cost is estimated by
	f(n)=h(n)
where,
	h(n):estimated cost from node n to goal

algorithm:
Step 1: Place the starting node into the OPEN list. 
Step 2: If the OPEN list is empty, Stop and return failure. 
Step 3: Remove the node n, from the OPEN list which has the lowest value of h(n), and places 
	it in the CLOSED list. 
Step 4: Expand the node n, and generate the successors of node n. 
Step 5: Check each successor of node n, and find whether any node is a goal node or not. 
	If any successor node is goal node, then return success and terminate the search, else proceed
	to Step 6. 
Step 6: For each successor node, algorithm checks for evaluation function f(n), and then check 
	if the node has been in either OPEN or CLOSED list. If the node has not been in both lists, 
	then add it to the OPEN list. 
Step 7: Return to Step 2.

properties of greedy best first search:
optimality: not optimal as it tries to get close to goal at each step and ignore cost so far g(n)
completeness: incomplete may loop indefinitely or miss goal in cyclic graphs
time complexity: O(b^m) m: max depth of search space
space complexity: O(b^m) m: max depth of search space

unification:
making 2 different logical atomic expression idential by finding a substituation
meaning of setntace shouldnt be chages but it should b eexpressed in multiple ways
let p and q be 2 stomic sentences and θ be a unifier such athat pθ=qθ then it can be 
expressed as UNIFY(p,q)
	UNIFY(p,q)=θ where SUBST(θ,p)=SUBST(θ,q)

replacing speciifc elemtns i nsatement with variabls that can range over larger set of elements
eg: john is a man beomces x is a man

resolution:
inferenfe method in fopl to deriv econsluions from set of premiese

steps for resolution:
1. express all statements in fopl
2. convert fopl into cnf form (conjunction of disjunction)
3. negate goal statement
4. apply resolution rule by drawing resolution graph
begin resolution process:
	identify complementary literals
	unifiy if necessary
	resolve 2 calusese,eliminating complementary loiterals to produce new cluase
	repeat until empty caluse is derived indicating contradiction, proving orignal conclusion
	or until no new cluse can be derived then conclusion cant be derived from premisises
5. interpret result

naive bayes modeL;
supervised learning algorithm used to solve classification problems 
based on bayes theorm and predicts coutomces based on probabilites

working mechanism:
-bayes theorem:
uses bayes theorem to calculate posterior probablity using conditional proablity
P(H/E)=P(E/H).P(H)/P(E)
where 
	P(H/E): posteriror
	P(E/H): likelihood
	P(H): prior
	P(E): marginal

-naive assumption:
makes the fundametanl assumption taht all featuers involved are independet of one another
eg: if predicting whether a fruit is apple based on color,shape,tastse, naive assumes that
color contributes to classificaiton independtly of shape feature

-process: FIG
convert data set into frequcny table->create likelihood table(probabilit of feautre)->
use bayes theorem to calculate posteriro probablity

AI:
branch of science that deals with buidling helping machines that solve complex problems in
human like fashioin

on basis of behaviuor AI can be defined in 2 ways:
1. acting humanly: The Turing Test approach (Chinese room argument)
The Turing Test by Alan Turing says that a computer passes thte test if the human interrogator,
who gives written questions cant tell if the respoosne was written by a computer or human.
The tset is for a program to have a converstaion with the interrogator for 5 minutes and it passes
if the interrogator is fooled 30% of the time. eg chatbots that mimc human converstation
must have following capabilities:
	knowledge represnetation: store what it knows/hears
	natural language processing: comms in English
	machine learning: adapt to new circumstances and extrapolate patterns
	automate dreasoning: store info and draw  conclusions

2. acting rationally: The rational agent approach
a rational agent is one that acts to acheive the best possible result or best expected outcome
in case of uncertainty. the goal of this approach is to build agents that maximize performanc
using best possible decision in each situation.
acting rationally means doing things that lead to best results. may mean doing something that
works best enough. eg pulling our hand away after touching hot stove. action is smart although
we didnt reason about it. better than others since it is flexible and scientific
eg: autonomus vechiles that make decsion based on sensor data to avoid obstacles and reach dest

agent:
anthing that perceives its enivornent through esnsors and acts uppon it using actuators
to achieve its goal
fig

utility agent:
uses utiliy function to measure preference amoing multipe goals since goals alone arent enough
to generate high qulaity behaviour in most enviroments. utility describes how happy the agent is.
it compares and prefers better outcome samong several to reach a goal.
eg: delivery drone that selcets route with blacne of speed,safety and battery usage
fig

game search:
game is a complex multi agent environment that gives rise to adversarial serach which invlives
navigating htroughg game tree containg all possible moves and counter moves. moves represent
the actions of multiple agents.
game is formally defined as a search problem with following elemts:
S0: inital state that defiens how game is set up at start
PLAYER(s): defines which player has the move in state s
ACTION(s): defines set of legal moves in state s
RESULT(s,a): defines result of action a in state s
TERMINAL-TEST(s): checks if game is over in state s
UTILITY(s,p): defines final numeric value for game that ends in terminal state s for player p

minmax algorithm in game search:
recursive search strategyused in 2 player adversarial games to simulate all possible move and 
slecet the optimal moves for current player by assuming opponent playsa optimally

players:
MAX- tries to achieves max possible utiltiy value
MIN- tries to achieves min possible utiltiy value

mechanism:
DFS to explore entire game tree down to terminal nodes with fiexd utilty values

backtracking: as algo recursively returns from terminal nodes,
	-nodes controlled by MAX pick max value from children
	-nodes controlled by MIN pick min value from children

optimal decision:
value derived at root node(initila satE) represents highest value MAX can guarantee
aginst optimal oppnoent

step 1:
algorith generates enitre game tree
apply utility function to get utiliy value for terminal states
A is intial state
maximiser has worst case initila value - infinity
minimiser has wort case intila value + infinty

step 2:
find utility value for minimizer
copmare inital value and terminal state value and min will go to higher node

step 3:
find utility value for maximizer
copmare inital value and terminal state value and max will go to higher node

7.
semantic network:
graphjical knowledge representation technique compposed of nodes that repressent obejcts/
concepts/events linked by arcs/edges taht represnet relation between nodes like is-a has-a

components:
1. lexical: nodes,links,labels(denotes particular object/relation)
2. structural: links and nodes form directed graph where labels are placed on link and nodes
3. semantic: meaning are related to links and laels of nodes
4. procedural: cosntructors create new links,nodes and destructors romve them

8.
genetic algorithm:
search heuristic inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution and selection used
to solve optimization problems in machine learning. it operates on evolutionary generational
cycle to find high quality solution

flowchart: FIG

phases of ga:
initialziaiton: FIG
The process begins by randomly generating a set of candidate solutions called the population. 
Each individual solution is a chromosome, composed of genes (parameters).random binary strings
are used for initialization

fitness assignment: FIG
A fitness function is applied to evaluate the ability of each individual (chromosome) 
to solve the problem. Individuals receive a fitness score, and the higher the score, 
the higher the probability of being selected for reproduction.

selection: FIG
process of choosing 2 parents from population for crossing and reproduction for offspring
all selected individuals are arranged in a pair of twos to increase reproduction
these individuals transfer genes to next generation

-roulette wheel/fitness proportionate selection: 
 probabilitis selction that assigns probabiltiy of selection to each individual on the basis
of fitness, higher fitness more chance to get selected

-tournament selection:
running several tournaments among few individuals randomly chosen from population
winner of each tournament ie highest fitness is selected for next generation

-rank based selection:
assings selcetion probablity based on rank of individual's fitness rather than fitness itself
by sprting popuplation by fitness

reproduction:
2 bvariation operators are applied to parent population to create child

-crossover:
process of taking 2 parent solutions and prodcuing child
reproduction operator selects a random pair of 2 individuals for mating
cross site is selected at random along string length
position values are swapped between 2 strings following cross site

--single point crossover
2 mating chormosomes are cut once at coressponding points and sections after the cuts are exchanged
crossover point is selected at random

--2 point crossover
2 crossover points are chosen on parent chromosomes then segment between these points are
swapped to reate offspring

--livery/uniform crossover
each gene in offpsring is independent ly chosen from either parent with equal probability

--inheritable genetic algorithm:
cetrain genes are inherited by offspriong to ensure high quality solution
balance preservation with exploration - controlled diversity

-mutation:
mutation operator inserts random genes in offspring to maintain diversity in population
fliiping bits in chromosomes
solves problem of premature convergence and enchances diversification

--flip bit mutation:
a parent is chosen and mutation chromosome is randomly generated
for a 1 in mutation chromosome, coresspondign bit in parrent is flipped to  create child

--gaussian mutation:
addign random value drawn from gaussian distribution to individuals gene values

--exchange/swap mutation:
2 positions in chromosome are randomly selected and exchanged to create new individual

termiantion:
The cycle continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a pre-defined fitness 
threshold or a maximum number of iterations (epochs). The best individual in the final
 population is the solution.
