The ε-closure of a state (or set of states) in an ε-NFA is:
    The set of all states that can be reached from that state 
by taking any number (including zero) of ε-transitions only.
This includes:
    The state itself
    All states reachable from it using ε-transitions (i.e., transitions without consuming input)
