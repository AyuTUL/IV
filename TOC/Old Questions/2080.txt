An NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) is a finite automaton where:
    For a given state and input symbol, the machine can transition to zero, one, or many next states.
    It can have multiple transitions for the same input.
    It accepts a string if at least one path leads to an accepting (final) state.
NFA is a 5-tuple:
(Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F) where:
    Q: set of states
    Σ: input alphabet
    δ: transition function → Q × Σ → 2^Q
    q₀: start state, q brlongs to Q
    F: set of final states, F subset of Q

CFG:
A Context-Free Grammar (CFG) is a formal grammar used to describe the 
syntax of languages (especially programming languages and natural languages).
Definition:
A CFG is a 4-tuple G=(V,T,P,S), where:
    V is a finite set of variables (non-terminal symbols),
    T is a finite set of terminal symbols (alphabet of the language),
    P is a finite set of production rules of the form 
		A→αA→α, where A∈V and α∈(V∪T)∗ (a string of terminals and/or non-terminals),
	S∈V is the start symbol.

pumping lemma:
Let L be a regular language. Then there exists a pumping length p such that for
 any string w∈L, if ∣w∣≥p, then we can write:
w=xyz
such that:
    ∣y∣>0
    ∣xy∣≤p
    For all n≥0, the string xynz∈L
