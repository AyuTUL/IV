extended transistion function of NFA:
delta cap is a function taht takes a state q and a string of input symbols W as input and
gives set of states as outpout. It can return 1/more states.

CFG:
CFG is a formal grammar used to gegenrate context free language\
it is defined as a 4 tuple: G=(V,T,P,S)
V: set of variables/non-terminals
T: set of termianls
P: production rules, A->alpha where alpha=(V U T)* and A belongs to V
S: starting symbol

kleen vs positive closure:
length os tring 0/more 		1/more
contains empty string epsilon	no epsilon
sigma*				sigma+

pupming lemma:
if A is a regular language then A has pumping length P such that any string S where |S|>=P
may be divided into 3 parts,z S=xyz such that follkowing coniitons ,must be true:
	xy^iz belognms to a for all i>=0
	|y|>0
	|xy|<=P

Arden's therom:
if P and Q are 2 regular expressions and P doesnt contain empty string epsilon then eqn R=Q+RP
has unique soln R=QP*
