extended transistion function of NFA:
delta cap is a function taht takes a state q and a string of input symbols W as input and
gives set of states as outpout. It can return 1/more states.

CFG:
CFG is a formal grammar used to gegenrate context free language\
used to describe syntax of languages
it is defined as a 4 tuple: G=(V,T,P,S)
V: finite set of variables/non-terminals
T: finite set of termianls
P: production rules, A->alpha where alpha=(V U T)* and A belongs to V
S: starting symbol, S belongs to V

TM:
abstract machines used to simulate any modern coimputers
formally defined as 7 tuple: TM=(Q,Σ,Γ,δ,q₀,B,F)
Q: finite set of states
Σ: finite set of input symbols
Γ: finite set of tape symbols
δ: transistion function δ:QxΣ->Γx(R/L)xQ
q₀: starting state, q belongs to Q
B: blank symbol
F: set of final states, F subset of Q

δ(q,X)=(p,Y,D)
q: current state
X: current tape symbol pointed at by tape head
p: next state
D: =L, tapes head moves left by 1,=R tape head moves right by 1

kleen vs positive closure:
length os tring 0/more 		1/more
contains empty string epsilon	no epsilon
sigma*				sigma+

pupming lemma:
if A is a regular language then A has pumping length P such that any string S where |S|>=P
may be divided into 3 parts,z S=xyz such that follkowing coniitons ,must be true:
	xy^iz belognms to a for all i>=0
	|y|>0
	|xy|<=P

Multi Stack TM					Semi infinte Tape TM
uses more than one stack			tape is infinite only in right direction
memory is 2/more stacks in LIFO			memoryt is single tape that is infinite at one end
no tape,push and pop on stack			head can move left or right but not beyond left end
computeational power is equivalent to ordinary TM
easier to model certain lang like PDA's		simpler since one side of tape is restricted
similar to recursiv efunction calls		memory iwth fixed starting boundary(array)

intractablility:
problem is intractable if no program can solve it in limited amouintof time/space
alothough program is decidable(solvable in theory), cant be solved efficeinty
techoinuqr of solving problems that cant be solved in polynomial timem susally exponential
time algorithms

time complexity:
time complexity of TM T is function T Time (x) where it is the no. of stesps taken by the
computation T(x). if T(x) doesnt halt, T Time (x) is undefined

spac ecomplexity:
space complexity of TM T is function T Space (x) where is the no. of disctinct tape cells
visited during cimouation T(x). if T(x) doesnt halt, T Space (x) is undefined

Arden's therom:
if P and Q are 2 regular expressions and P doesnt contain empty string epsilon then eqn R=Q+RP
has unique soln R=QP*
