extened function of dfa:
transition function that takes state q and string W as input and gives new state p as output

CNF:
A Context-Free Grammar (CFG) is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) if every production rule is of 
one of the following forms:
    A→BC
        Where A,B,C∈V (non-terminals) and B, C are not the start symbol
    A→a
        Where a∈Σa∈Σ (a terminal)

E-NFA:
An ε-NFA (Epsilon Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) is an NFA that allows
 transitions without consuming any input symbol, called epsilon (ε) transitions.

Formally, ε-NFA is a 5-tuple:
(Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F) where:
    Q: set of states
    Σ: input alphabet
    δ: transition function → Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) → P(Q)
    q₀: start state
    F: set of final states
