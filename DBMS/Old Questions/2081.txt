enitty is an objedct that exists in real word independently
may be physical(employeE) or conceptual (job)

entity type is set of entites that share same attributes
eg: entity type employee defiens all emplyess

entity set is set of collection of entities of particular entitiy type stored in database
at any point in time
referred to using same name as entity type

ER diagram for airline ticket booking
1. identify entities:
	customer,flight,ticket

2. set attributes to entites
	customer-cid(PK),cname,address,email,no. of visits)
	flight-flightno.(PK),source,destination,deprature_time
	ticket-tid(PK),number_bought,discount

3. establish relationships
	customer books ticket
	ticket belogns to filght

4. set mapping cardinalities
	1 customer books N ticket
	1 ticket belogns to 1 filght

3.
transaction is defined as coolection fo several opetaions on database that appears to be
single unit from POV of database user. eg transfwer of funds from oen account to another
ius single unit from custpemrs POV but within database ysstem, it consisst of several tasks

atomicity:
-enusres transaction is either completely executed or not at all
-if trnasaction is unsuccessful due to failure/contraints, any chagnes made to adatabase udring
transaction must b undone throuh ROLLBACK/ABORT command
-prevents database from staying in partial state

consistency:
-ensures that after complete excution of transaction wiothout interferecen from other
concurretn transaction, takes database from one consistent state to anotther
-state during excution if called inconsistent state which must be hidden to user

isolation:
-trnsaction is not interfered by concurrent exeuction of other transactions
-satte of database after concurretn execution of transaction must be equivalent to state
reached after serial execution of trnsaction in same orer
-effects on database due to execution of transaction must ber invisible to another transaction
until it has been sucessfully committed

durability:
-chqanges applied to database afte rexcution of transaction must be persistent
-once transation is committed, all updates to database must remain permanentyl even during
failures like syustem crash and power loss

conflict serializability:
used to identify  correct schedules when transaction executions are interleaved
schedule is correct if it is equivalent to serial schedule

a schedule is conflict serializable if it is equiavlent to serial schedule by swapping
non-cinflicting operations or its precedence graph of commited trasnactions is acyclic

conflicting oeprations:
-they belong to differet transactions
-they operate on same data item
-at least one of them is write operation

4.
referential integrity contraint is rule defined bewtween 2 relations in a database to maitnain
consistency among teh tupels in those relations
implemented by using a foreign key that points to the primary to of another relation

tom aintain logical consistenc of database state
if a ar ecord exists in one table(dependent table R1), the record it referecnes in other table
(parent table R2) alsos must exist
prevents creation of orphan data, situtation where foreign key points to primary key value
that doesnt exist or has been deleted

eg: club(jersey PK), player(jersey pk)

3 schema architecture is a framwwork to spearate database into 3 lvels of abstraction to
seprate user apps from physical database and allow data independece to simplify dataavse mgmt,
maintenance and secuirty

internal level/physical schema:
-olwest level of abstraction
-decribes how data is physically stored in database
-includes file structures,indexes,compression,storage devices
-eg: student data is stored as binary records in files on hard ish sorted by roll

conceptual elve/logical shcema:
-middle level of abstration
-describes structure of entire database for community of users
-independent of physical storage thorugh physcia ldata independec
-includes entites,relationships,constraintsr(PK,FK),data types
-eg: STudent(Roll,anem,major) is a alogica ltable with roll as PK

external level/view schema:
-higesht level of asbtraction
-describes how individual suers/apsp see data
-each user can have customized view
-independent of conceptual level thorugh logical data independec
-allows access control,simplification,security
eg: teachers view:Student(roll,name), finance depratment view: sTudent(roll,feeStatus)

6. informal desgin guidelines for relational schema
-imparting clear semantics to attributes in relations
-reducing redundant information in tuples
-reducing null values in tuples
-disallow possiblity of generating spurirous tuples

dat amodesl are collection of conceptual tools for describing data,relationsihps ,data semantics
and data constinats

I. objectb ased logical models:
-represent data as objects, simliar to oop concept
-focuse on encapsuilation,inheritance and polymorphism, suitable for compelxt data strucutres

i. ER model: FIG
-represnets real word data in structured way
-designign datavbase structure by defning enties with attributes connected via relationshi
and contraints before actual implementation
entoty is distinguisahbe object that exists, each antity is associated with set of attributes
describing it, relationship is assocaition among several ennities, set of all entitesi or realtion
of same type si caleld enity/relationship set,mapping cardinalites express no. of entities to which
another entity can be associated via relationship set

ii.object oriented model:
-integrate4d oop concept with database system
-repesnets data as objects like in oop in java,c++
stores dat aas objects, functions called methods that work on that data
obejcts are grouped into claseses acting as templates
to hange object, we use its methods keeping internal detilas hidden
no need to rewrite whoile prorgam tro update behaviour
for hadling compelxreadl word data

II. record based logical model:
-organizes data into fixed format records like rows in a table
-each record is made of fields(aatricbutes), each field holds a type
-describes how data is structured at logcail elvel

i. relational model: FIG name,position,salary position,salary
-data and relationsihps are represeneted by collection of tables(relations)\
-each table has rows(rrecords/tuples) and columns(attributes)

ii. netwrok model: FIG
-data is stored as records conenced by links like a graph
-relationships are represented by pointers

iii. hierarchical model: FIG
-data is organized in tree structure
-each parent can have many children but each child only has one parent
-relationsihp is reprsent d by values contained by records

III. physical data model:
-shows how data is actually tstode in computer like on hard drives,memory,storage blocsk
-deals with low level details like file formats,indexzes,block sizeas,access methods
-used by DBAs to optimize performance
-eg: student records stoed as binary file inxdex by roll in fixed blokc legnth for fast earch

i. unifying model: represnste all types of data structreus in single unified way
ii. frame memory: represents data in frames, wihch are blocks/chunks of memory, each frame
stores bnoth data and metad data about strctre of data

IV. self describing model:
-semi structured data model meaning adta comes with its own descriptoipn(metadat)
-metadata describse strctuer o data,data types,relationships among data
-eg: in relational database, system stores info about tables(like colulmn anme nad ata types)
in data dictironary so users dont need to defien them separtely

8.
data- rawfacts found after iobservation/experiment, not meaningful
database-collection of data in orgaminzed manner
dbms-computerized records keeping system for storing,manipulating and retreieving data
database sytem-collective system of compponents fro reguatling,mangaing and using database
including hardware,people,techniques for haandling database
dbms catalog-part of database system that stores schema description
contians info called meta data such as structure of each file,type and storage format of ata tiem

9.
join is binary relation operator used to combine tuples of multiple relation on the bsis
of matching values in common atrbiutes
cartesian product of relation followed by selection criteria

FIG club player plyaer jersey

I. inner join: resulting join relation only includes tuples satusfying matching criteria,exclusindf

i. theta join: join condition can be any comparison operator (<>+>+<+!=)
ii. equi join: join condition can only be equality ocmparison operator
iii. natural join: tupels are joined by matching same values in common atrributes and elimitn
redundant attributes

II. outer join: resulting join reslation includes tuples satisfying matchign criteria as well
as tupels with missing criteria

i. left outer join: resulting join relation includes all tupels of left relation. tuples in left
relation without matfhing values in right relation have atrributes filled by NULL vaue
ii. right outer join: resulting join relation includes all tuples of right relation. tuples in
right relation without matchign values in left relation have attributes filled by NULL value
iii. full outer join: resulting join relation has all tuples of both relations, tupels of any
relation without matchign values in other relation have attributes filled by NULL value

10.
deferred update approach is know as NO-UNDO/REDO recovery based on deferred update
defer/postpone any actual updates to database on disj until transaction successfully compeltes
its execution and reaches its commit point
after transaction reaches its commit point and log is force written to disk,only then are the 
updates recorded in the database

if a transaction fails before reacign tsi commit poitn, there is no ned to undo any operations
becasue the transaction has not affected database on disk in anyway
so only REDO type log entries are needed in log(including new value AFTER of item)
UNDO type log entries arent needed during recoverry

11.
deadlocks is condition wher no process proceeds fore execution and each waits for resources
acquired by other process aka circular waiting
occur in concurrencyt control scenario when using lokcign techniques where transactions
block each other indefinitely while trying to acquire exclsuive rights to data items

specializtion and generaliztino are used inEER diagram to handle sub and super classes
FIG

specialization:
-top down approach
-higher level entity(superclass) is broken down into 2/more lower level entites(subclass)
-for maximizing te difference between members of entity by identifying their unique attrbiutes
-eg:breaking down emplyee into player and coach based on role

generaliaation:
-bottom up approachj
-2/more lower level entiteis are combined to form higer level entity
-eg: combing haaland,kane,mbappe into generalized entity striker

constraints:
membership constraints: determine how entiyt become member of subclass

-condition-defined constraints: membership in subclass is determined automatically by evaluating
a condition/predicate applied to atributes of superclass

-user defined constraitns:membership in subclass is explicityly specifed for each entity in
subclass by databse users during operations

disjoint constraints: specify whether entity can belong to more than 1 sublcass iwhn specialis

-disjoint constraint: specifies that entity can be member of at most one subclass of speclia
-overlapping constraint: specfies that entity can can belong to more than one subclass simultan

completeness constraints: specify whether evry entity in superclass must be member of some sub

-total participation constraint: every entity in superclass must be a member of at least one subclass

-partial participation constantin: entity in superclass may not belong to any subclass
