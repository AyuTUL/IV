normaliation is proces sof breaking down bad relation into samller relations to minimize
data redundacny,insertion,update,delte anomailes manitain dat aconsistnecy

unf: jersey player club competition (location league)

1nf:
-doesnt contain compsite/multi value attributes
-domain of attribute must be atomic
jersey# player club# location league

2nf:
-every non prime attribute must be fully dependent on prime attribute(no partial dependecy)
jersey* player , club# location league, jersey#,club#

3nf:
-every non prime atrribute must bne non transitigely dependt on prmie atrvite
jersey# platyer, club# location, club# league, jersey# club#

2pl:
concurreny control protocl for serilzability
process used to gain ownership of hared resources wtihout creatin gpossiblity of deadlock
in distributesd systems
a transaction following 2pl has alllock operations preced first unlock operation

trnasaction lieftime is divied into 2 distinct phaes:
growing phase:
-acuisition only: transciton can only acquite locks shread(s) or exclusive(x) but cant release
-lock point: trnascaiont acuire locks nutil all locks for execu,point hwere final lock is acquired
-updgraindg: lock conversion shared to excluse may be perfomred

shrinking phase:
-release only: only release locks but cant acqurie new locoks
-downgrading: lock conversion X to S

types of 2pl:
strict:
-all X held by transaction are released only after transaction commits
-schedule is recovedrasble and cascadeless, possible deadlock

rigorous:
-most restricve variant
-both X and S are held until commit

conservative:
-compelte deadlock prevention
-transction must pre declare and lock all iteswm it needs befreo excution
-if cant acquire all necesary locks,waits withtou locking until all are availbe


locks are concurrency control protocl that uses locks to synchronize access

binary lock:
2 sates 1,0
if data tietm is locked(1), cant be accessed b any transtition tateempteing t operfroem
data oepration on it
item can only be access when lock is 0

shared(s):
read locked
gratns permission
multiple trnsactions can hold S lock concurerntly on same item suince reading donest change data

excluseive(x):
write locked
grants perssion to read and write data item
only single transation can hold X lock on item at a tim

dbms is software ystem to store,retruve,amange and maniuplate data efficienlty
strucutred way of organizing data in database ensuring data integrity,security and easy access

traditional file system is method of storing data in flat files(.dat,.csv) without strucutre
database, each file contains recors dbut there is no relationshoip between files, leading to
dta redundacny and inconsistency

data redundancy control: normalization, redudnat data in multipel loations
data consistency: constraints, manual
dat asharing: concurrent access b multiple users, one user at a time
data integrity: accuracy and validy by contraints and validation
security: authenticsation,authoriazation,acces control at various levels
backup and refovery: built in from failurs
data independece: seprate physical storage from logica lrepresntation change wihtout affect
effiecient qurery prcescicng: powerful query langulage like sql for complex dat aretrival
centralized mgmt: single repo for data with central admin
concurrecy control:mange simulatnrous access by multiople users to prevent inconsistencies
