normaliation is proces sof breaking down bad relation into samller relations to minimize
data redundacny,insertion,update,delte anomailes manitain dat aconsistnecy

unf: jersey player club competition (location league)

1nf:
-doesnt contain compsite/multi value attributes
-domain of attribute must be atomic
jersey# player club# location league

2nf:
-every non prime attribute must be fully dependent on prime attribute(no partial dependecy)
jersey* player , club# location league, jersey#,club#

3nf:
-every non prime atrribute must bne non transitigely dependt on prmie atrvite
jersey# platyer, club# location, club# league, jersey# club#

relation algebra is procedural language that decribes how to obtain reulst
takes instance of relation as input and gives instrance of realtion as output
uses operator to perform queries

selkect(sigma):
unary operation
used for slecting subset of tupels from realtion accorin to given selection conditrion

proiject(pie):
unary relational operator
selecting certain atrributes from relation and discarding other coumls

union(U):
binary realtion operatr for union of 2 union compatible relations
inclues all tuples in both relaions and elimintea duplicat etuples

set difference(-):
binary relation operator that finds tuples in 1 but not in 2

cartesian product(x):
merges column from 2 rlations regrdles sof common attributes
all combintion of tupes of 2 relations

rename(rho):
rename relation name and attribute name
rho_s(B1,B2) (R) where S is new relation nae and B1,B2 ar new attribute names

database schema is overall desgin of database
defines structrue,data typs and costraints
physical schema,logical schema and sub schemas

DBA:
database users that maintain database description in original form
responsible for overall control of database system

schema definiton adn modifciotn: createtion and modifciton of orignal description of database
structure and the way that structure is reflected by files of physical database

storagestrcuter and access method defn:
determinse how data is physcially soted on dis,including file organization,portionaing
and tablespace mgmmt. dba chooess best acces methdos fro query efficiny through indeing
strats liek b tree,hasmaps.bitmaps

granting authoriation for data acecs: granting as=cess to database to different users

routine maintenance:making backu copies of adatabawe and repaijing damange top databse
due to hardawre/software failure/misue

6.
referential integrity contraint is rule defined bewtween 2 relations in a database to maitnain
consistency among teh tupels in those relations
implemented by using a foreign key that points to the primary to of another relation

tom aintain logical consistenc of database state
if a ar ecord exists in one table(dependent table R1), the record it referecnes in other table
(parent table R2) alsos must exist
prevents creation of orphan data, situtation where foreign key points to primary key value
that doesnt exist or has been deleted

eg: club(jersey PK), player(jersey pk)

7.
FD is relationship contraint among atributes ina relation
let A and B are atrributes of relation R 
if each value of B os associated with exactly one value of A, then B is said to be FD on A,A->B
A is determinant and B is object of determinant 
FD a->b holds if 2 tuiples have same value for a then they alkso have same values for b
if t1[A]=t2[A] then t1[B]=t2[B]

8.
need for concurrency prtoocl: acid

2pl:
concurreny control protocl for serilzability
process used to gain ownership of hared resources wtihout creatin gpossiblity of deadlock
in distributesd systems
a transaction following 2pl has alllock operations preced first unlock operation

trnasaction lieftime is divied into 2 distinct phaes:
growing phase:
-acuisition only: transciton can only acquite locks shread(s) or exclusive(x) but cant release
-lock point: trnascaiont acuire locks nutil all locks for execu,point hwere final lock is acquired
-updgraindg: lock conversion shared to excluse may be perfomred

shrinking phase:
-release only: only release locks but cant acqurie new locoks
-downgrading: lock conversion X to S

types of 2pl:
strict:
-all X held by transaction are released only after transaction commits
-schedule is recovedrasble and cascadeless, possible deadlock

rigorous:
-most restricve variant
-both X and S are held until commit

conservative:
-compelte deadlock prevention
-transction must pre declare and lock all iteswm it needs befreo excution
-if cant acquire all necesary locks,waits withtou locking until all are availbe

9.
need for database recovery: durability, atomic

shadow paging: FIG
recovery technique that considers database aas colection of fiexd size disk blocks

directory setup: directory is maintainded in nmemory whose entries point to most recent
datbawse pages(curretn directoy)

shadow copy: when trnsaction beins, curent directoryy is copied into shadow directory which is
saved on disk, curetn directory is used for transaction operations

updates: when a write operaion occurs, a new copy of modified page is created and writeen
elsewhere on unused disk block, old copy is not overwaritten

recovery/commit: old version is referece by sahdow directry and new version is referenced
by current directory, if transaction commits, current directoty becomes new shadow directory
if its fails, system reverts to sate pointed to by shadow directy, effectilvy ignoring
chanes made by failed trsanction

transaction is defined as coolection fo several opetaions on database that appears to be
single unit from POV of database user. eg transfwer of funds from oen account to another
ius single unit from custpemrs POV but within database ysstem, it consisst of several tasks

atomicity:
-enusres transaction is either completely executed or not at all
-if trnasaction is unsuccessful due to failure/contraints, any chagnes made to adatabase udring
transaction must b undone throuh ROLLBACK/ABORT command
-prevents database from staying in partial state

consistency:
-ensures that after complete excution of transaction wiothout interferecen from other
concurretn transaction, takes database from one consistent state to anotther
-state during excution if called inconsistent state which must be hidden to user

isolation:
-trnsaction is not interfered by concurrent exeuction of other transactions
-satte of database after concurretn execution of transaction must be equivalent to state
reached after serial execution of trnsaction in same orer
-effects on database due to execution of transaction must ber invisible to another transaction
until it has been sucessfully committed

durability:
-chqanges applied to database afte rexcution of transaction must be persistent
-once transation is committed, all updates to database must remain permanentyl even during
failures like syustem crash and power loss

12.
specializtion and generaliztino are used inEER diagram to handle sub and super classes
FIG

specialization:
-top down approach
-higher level entity(superclass) is broken down into 2/more lower level entites(subclass)
-for maximizing te difference between members of entity by identifying their unique attrbiutes
-eg:breaking down emplyee into player and coach based on role

generaliaation:
-bottom up approachj
-2/more lower level entiteis are combined to form higer level entity
-eg: combing haaland,kane,mbappe into generalized entity striker

constraints:
membership constraints: determine how entiyt become member of subclass

-condition-defined constraints: membership in subclass is determined automatically by evaluating
a condition/predicate applied to atributes of superclass
-user defined constraitns:membership in subclass is explicityly specifed for each entity in
subclass by databse users during operations

disjoint constraints: specify whether entity can belong to more than 1 sublcass iwhn specialis

-disjoint constraint: specifies that entity can be member of at most one subclass of speclia
-overlapping constraint: specfies that entity can can belong to more than one subclass simultan

completeness constraints: specify whether evry entity in superclass must be member of some sub

-total participation constraint: every entity in superclass must be a member of at least one subclass
-partial participation constantin: entity in superclass may not belong to any subclass
